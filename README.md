# Hotel-Website
Hotel Project with HTML &amp; CSS
This here is a basic website with three pages namely; Index, Contact and about pages using just HTML and CSS with responsiveness to Large Screens and Mobile screens only.


#Index.html
This is the Homepage of a Hotel website which include common Classes used through out the project such as;
Container, 
current, 
text-primary, 
logo,  
bg-dark, 
box, 
bg-light, 
and id='' as well,
just like we'll  find in a framework.
The index page has the Hotel Logo wrapped in a container to ensure that the page width stays the same. Icon classes used were imported from fontawesome.com, 
the class .fa-3x is a common used increase icon size,

#About.html
This page also has the same structure as the index.html. I used float on both the former(#index) and this(#about) just to personally experiment but I prefer Flex.


#Contact
Same structure as mentioned above except for change in icon classes still aslo from fontawesome.com.
Finnaly if yu check properly you'll find embedded in all the CSS comments to better understand the use of classes in this project, sorry if my breakdown is not good enough I'm just learning to document, please do forgive me. Thanks
